## TASK 2 - CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
### Explanation of the Code:
##### 1. Loading the Data: We load the dataset from the provided path.
##### 2. Checking for Missing Values: We display the number of missing values in each column.
##### 3. Removing Missing Values: We remove rows with any NaN values.
##### 4. Counting Legitimate and Fraud Transactions: We print the count of each class (legitimate and fraud transactions).
##### 5. Defining Features and Target: We separate the features (X) and the target variable (y).
##### 6. Splitting the Data: We split the data into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split.
### Building and Evaluating Models:
##### 1. Logistic Regression: We train a logistic regression model and print the classification report.
##### 2. Decision Tree: We train a decision tree classifier and print the classification report.
##### 3. Random Forest: We train a random forest classifier and print the classification report.
##### 4. Confusion Matrices: We print the confusion matrices for each model to get a detailed view of the model performance.
##### 5. Make Predictions: Finally, we can use the trained models to make predictions on new data.
## TASK 4 - SPAM SMS DETECTION
#### To build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate, we'll follow these steps:

###### 1. Load and Explore the Data
###### 2. Preprocess the Data
###### 3. Convert Text to Numerical Features
###### 4. Train a Classifier
###### 5. Evaluate the Model
###### 6. Make Predictions
##### Let's get started.

### 1. Load and Explore the Data
We'll load the dataset and take a look at the first few rows to understand its structure.

### 2. Preprocess the Data
Preprocessing steps include:

##### a. Removing punctuation and special characters
##### b. Converting text to lowercase
##### c. Removing stop words (common words that don't add much meaning)

### 3. Convert Text to Numerical Features
We can use either TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings to convert text data into numerical features.

### 4. Train a Classifier
We can train classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.

### 5. Evaluate the Model
We'll evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 6. Make Predictions
Finally, we'll use the trained model to classify new SMS messages.
