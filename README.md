## TASK 4 - SPAM SMS DETECTION
#### To build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate, we'll follow these steps:

###### 1. Load and Explore the Data
###### 2. Preprocess the Data
###### 3. Convert Text to Numerical Features
###### 4. Train a Classifier
###### 5. Evaluate the Model
###### 6. Make Predictions
##### Let's get started.

### 1. Load and Explore the Data
We'll load the dataset and take a look at the first few rows to understand its structure.

### 2. Preprocess the Data
Preprocessing steps include:

##### a. Removing punctuation and special characters
##### b. Converting text to lowercase
##### c. Removing stop words (common words that don't add much meaning)

### 3. Convert Text to Numerical Features
We can use either TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings to convert text data into numerical features.

### 4. Train a Classifier
We can train classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.

### 5. Evaluate the Model
We'll evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 6. Make Predictions
Finally, we'll use the trained model to classify new SMS messages.
